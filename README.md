## Troubleshooting

#### Can't install RMagick. Can't find libMagick or one of the dependent libraries. Check the mkmf.log file for more detailed information

Typically this message means that one or more of the libraries that ImageMagick
depends on hasn't been installed. Examine the mkmf.log file in the ext/RMagick
subdirectory of the installation directory for any error messages. These
messages typically contain enough additional information for you to be able to
diagnose the problem. Also see [this FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20131206133600/http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/install-faq.html#libmagick).

On OS X with Homebrew, try (re)installing pkg-config:

```sh
brew uninstall pkg-config
brew install pkg-config
brew unlink pkg-config
brew link pkg-config
```
